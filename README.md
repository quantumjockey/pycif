pycif
=====

PyCIF is a python module for reading from, writing to, and manipulating International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) CIF-formatted data files.

This software is a collaborative effort among [Nicola B. DiPalma](http://nicoladipalma.com/), [Oliver Tschauner, Ph.D.](http://geoscience.unlv.edu/people/olivertschauner.html), and scientists at the [University of Nevada, Las Vegas High Pressure Science and Engineering Center (HiPSEC)](http://hipsec.unlv.edu/). This software is intended to augment current data analysis capabilities at HiPSEC and is freely available through this repository for use by members of the scientific community.

Notes
-----

Code in this script has been composed in a self-documenting fashion and styled for readability where possible. Comments have been placed within source where readability is limited, and where functionality is a direct consequence of material esoteric to crystallographic study.

This version of pycif was developed using Python version 3.x on Mac OSX v10.9.x; included modules have not yet been tested in the Microsoft Windows environment as of this writing.
